# Software Development Engineer in Test

In this exercise you will have 3 hours to create tests and supporting functions in Java to test certain user journeys through GitHub using its API.

Write three tests to verify the following user journeys:

1. As a user, I want to be able to login, see my details, and get a list of my repositories.
2. As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and view a repository.
3. As a user, I want to be able to create an Issue, get a list of Issues for my repo, and add / view comments on that Issue.

Your code should be written to maximise its maintainability and reusability.

Refer to the GitHub API v3 documentation for information: https://developer.github.com/v3/ 

GitHub model classes may be imported, if desired, from:

https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github/tree/master/org.eclipse.egit.github.core#core-orgeclipseegitgithubcore 

This project cotains code to import these model classes usign Maven. There is also a single test function to demostarte usage.

You don't need to use these classes and can use choose to use communcition mechanism to make API requests.

You may also want to use an existing test framework.

You must use your own GitHub account and need to generate and access token.
